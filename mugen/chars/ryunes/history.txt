28/04/2006 (dd/mm/yyyy): Code standard update
I've updated Ryu to my lastest code standard and fixed some minor bugs.
Tjis update is solely because I was already working on him for my game and
that I asked KFM to host my works at Randomselect.
Nothing else.

Kisses.

27/01/2006 (dd/mm/yyyy): Minor tweak release
I've just tweaked some of Ryu's hitdef vels and fixed some minor bugs.
Nothing else.

10/03/2005 (dd/mm/yyyy): Minor bug fix release
I noticed that fire hadouken wasn't knocking enemies down when close, so I'm releasing this
small update to fix this issue.
Also, I've changed his sounds to the awful 8khz psx sounds to make him compliant with my other
SF2 Nes chars.
That's it.

See ya.

06/03/2005 (dd/mm/yyyy): Public release
Well, that's it. He is done. And my knee still bleeds a week after the damn surgery. :P
I have no more left to say.

Thanks to Caddie, Loona and the mugenshock crew for the feedback. 

28/02/2005 (dd/mm/yyyy): Closed final gamma plus alpha zero ex 4
Well, here we are... A few boring days, a knee surgery and some
time to spare.
Sum it all and you have Ryu NES closed final gamma plus alpha zero
ex 4 (long name for nothing :P).
He is your usual Ryu in a smaller scale.
Have fun.

Thanks to Messatsu for the negative edge code.
Thanks to Lady Kiki for the feedback 

(and, no, no evil Ryu nor Gouki mode for now. :P)

Kisses,

SMEE.
